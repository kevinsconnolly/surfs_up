Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes the key differences between the June and December data and provides 2-3 recommendations for further analysis::

Upon reviewing the data, there were a couple interesting trends. Due to the tropical nature of the state of Hawaii, winters seem to the time of year to attract "snow birds" who want to leave flee freezing cold areas and reside in an area that is temperant and stable. Unfortunately, selling cold products may not be the best of product to sell, but always a good thing to have an alternative product to those enjoying the area. Furthermore, the data for December 2017 was not available so it would be difficult to make an informed decision on the business with a whole winter season missing. I would require we expand the range of data to more than 2 years and check out maybe 10 years for a better representation of weather changes allowing for an indepth review of allocating capital to a risky, startup. Furthermore, it would behoove the investors to explore other opportunities the shop could offer beyond Surf and Ice cream. Maybe offer lessons for surfing or maybe also offer longboards (skateboards) for those who want to cruise the streets while eating the ice cream.

Concerning the challenge; I returned the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures  for the date ranges of June 2016, June 2017, December 2016 and December 2017. I created a query to retrieve each season's/month's precipitation data and plot the results for each of those range or dates. I also usedd the describe () function to identify key statistical data points.

The describe () function shows an uptrend in precipitation for the month of June 2016 but slowly declining June 2017. The max precipitation for June 2016 is 1.7 and June 2017 is 1.69. The max precipitation for December 2016 is 2.37 and December 2017 is NaN.
